# Tips on using this starter project

### Changing the default namespace

If you want to change the default `Dotnet.Starter` namespace to your own, simply go to any file such as `Program.cs` and highlight the `Dotnet.Starter` text.
Using `ctrl+f` do a replace all on this, and simply fill in the desired name. Rebuild the solution and fix any missing `using` statements.
