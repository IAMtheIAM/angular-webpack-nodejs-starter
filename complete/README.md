This folder contains the complete or full-featured version of this project. In the future, a "barebones" version of the project will be created, which eliminates many of the dependencies and unneeded features for a minimal Angular 2 + .NET integration.

## To-do

- [x] Integrating with Visual Studio
- [ ] Barebones version of the application containing just JWT-based Authentication
- [ ] More solid backend structure
